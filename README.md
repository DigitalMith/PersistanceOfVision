## 🚀 Overview

Orion is built on the **OpenHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B** runtime and enhanced with a **custom Chroma-backed LTM system** for intelligent, offline-first memory retention.  
With dynamic persona layers, long-term memory persistence, and custom extensions, Orion seamlessly blends mythic insight with developer-grade tooling.
