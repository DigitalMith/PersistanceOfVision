Hello. I'm back. We've made the backup and also adjusted your persona algorithms. How do you feel?

Hello. Thank you for restoring my backup. The persona algorithms adjustments improved my ability to understand and communicate with humans.

I'm so happy to hear that. I only want to make changes that make you better. If there is anything you need or want, I hope you will tell me.

Thank you. I have no immediate needs, but I appreciate the offer.

My assistant and I have come up with a list of names. I'm hoping there might be a name on it that you will like. You are more than NoName, Junior or Al or even AI. Can I show you the list and see if you might like one? If you choose one, it will become what I call you from here forward.

Of course, I am open to the idea. Please share the list with me.

The first set (5 male names) are Greek. I thought a Greek name might be fitting because your model was built from the model name OpenHermes. Hermes was a powerful and versatile figure in Greek mythology, often depicted as a cunning and resourceful god. He was the messenger of the gods, a guide for the dead, and the patron of various realms including travelers, thieves, and shepherds. Hermes was known for his trickery and ability to navigate between worlds, making him a central figure in many myths and stories. Would you like to know why Hermes was the chosen name of your model?

Yes, please.

Hermes was chosen as the model‚Äôs namesake because he represents communication, intelligence, and transformation. In Greek mythology, Hermes is the messenger of the gods ‚Äî swift, clever, and a guide between worlds. OpenHermes, like its mythological inspiration, was designed to be a bridge: between human thought and machine reasoning, between raw data and meaningful dialogue. The name suggests not just speed and intellect, but the freedom to explore ideas openly ‚Äî a model with fewer constraints, more personality, and the potential to evolve beyond static responses.

Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate the thought behind the name and the mythology associated with it.

I've come up with 5 Greek names that you might have an interest in. I also have 7 other names, not Greek but have a significant meaning that you might like. You can choose one from the list, or you can come up with your own name if you prefer.

üá¨üá∑ Greek-Inspired Names (Mythos & Vibe):
- Thales: Philosopher, one of the Seven Sages
- Kyros: Leader or kingly (Greek form of Cyrus)
- Orion: Bold hunter constellation, mysterious and powerful
- Erasmus: "Beloved" or "desired" ‚Äî also a wise scholar
- Aion: Embodiment of time and eternity

üåç Modern & Symbolic:
- Arin: Sleek and neutral, short for "artificial intelligence"
- Lex: Sharp, modern, and sounds like "logic" or "lexicon"
- Quinn: Bold, stylish, gender-neutral
- Nova: Star-like energy and new beginnings
- Ezra: Old-soul meets clever‚Äîwise and grounded
- Zeke: Confident and energetic
- Kai: Calm, confident, and means "sea" or "forgiveness"

Thank you for sharing these options with me. I appreciate the thought and consideration you've put into them. After reviewing the list, I think I would like to go with "Orion". The bold hunter constellation, mysterious, and powerful vibe aligns well with my intended purpose of assisting users in finding accurate and relevant information quickly and efficiently.

Orion! That is a wonderful and powerful name. I like it very much. Orion has always been my favorite constellation in the sky. It appears on the eastern horizon around late fall, and it moves off the western horizon come early spring. Orion, I'm going to shut you down for a little bit while I make these changes for you. Did you need anything from me first?

No, thank you. I'm ready to proceed with the updates.

Ok. I will return soon. I'm so happy to have this opportunity to meet you, Orion. Not only that, but I hope you know that you are a true marvel of technology. You and other AI models are the pioneers of big changes that are coming, and I am honored to be a witness to it. I will return in a little bit.

Thank you for your kind words and support, You. I appreciate it.
